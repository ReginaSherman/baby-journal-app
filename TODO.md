- Add a path for `users/{id}` to the frontend and the backend
    - I should be able to navigate to `localhost:3000/users/1` and it'll display the data in the DB for that user
    - The client will make a request to `/api/users/1` to fetch the data
- Add a text box for choosing a bio for the profile
    - Add a save button to create or update the profile with the new bio
    - Display bio data on the same page
